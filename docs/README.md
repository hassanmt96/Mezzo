### What We Are

Mezzo is **the** destination for musicians to share their personal experiences with music and the industry. After signing up, users can create articles to share their expeiences with our easy-to-use form. Users can also comment on stories to share their thoughts, follow their favorite authors, and even show support by liking the articles! It is a clone of the popular site, Medium.

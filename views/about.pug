            p#description Based off the blog-hosting site "Medium," Mezzo allows professional and undiscovered musicians, as well as music listeners, to share their experiences in music-making, education, and industry. We reject the idea that formal training denotes a larger part to play, and encourage all voices to deepen our musical knowledge and connnection as a community.
